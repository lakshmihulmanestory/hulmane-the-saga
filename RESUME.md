- `ancient_vehicle_description` — full description
- `modern_vehicle_name` — modern tech vehicle (e.g. "Ganda-Ratha — Rhino-Profile Armored Vehicle" for Assam)
- `modern_vehicle_description` — full description

## What to do when resuming

### Immediate fix needed (5 min)
The `data/villains.csv` vehicle columns need the same alignment check as heroes got.
Run this to verify:
```python
import csv
with open('data/villains.csv', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    r = csv.DictReader(f)
    rows = list(r)
    k = next(x for x in rows if x['id']=='karnataka')
    print(k['ancient_vehicle_name'])  # should be "Taksha-Vahana (The Earth Serpent Platform)"
```
If it shows wrong data, run the same header-fix script used for heroes.csv (insert missing field).

### Suggested next tasks (in order)
1. **Add vehicle images** — generate/collect vehicle art for each character into `media/states/<region>/<state>/` and `samples/media/states/...`
2. **Karnataka portrait update** — update `karnataka-portrait.html` to add a vehicle section showing both ancient and modern vehicles
3. **Character gallery update** — update `character-gallery.html` to show vehicle info in the modal popup
4. **Extend to other states** — build detailed portrait pages for Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Kerala (all have sample images in `samples/media/states/`)
5. **Generate remaining heroes CSV for Tamil Nadu** — Tamil Nadu has no samples yet, needs Gemini reference generation
